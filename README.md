We extend the bounded-confidence model. We assume assimilative influence when agents connected by positive relationships hold sufficiently similar opinions, adopting the core assumption of the bounded-confidence models. We combine this with another influential modeling approach, the notion that if agents connected by negative social relationship disagree too much, opinion differences increase due to repulsive influence. This allows us to vary the relative strength of assimilation and repulsion in the influence dynamics, also allowing for the possibility that neither occurs in a particular interaction.
